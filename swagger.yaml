  title: Version History REST API
  description: |
    REST API for common actions around document version history stored in
    __MongoDB__ via `mongo-service`.

    Responses are returned either encoded in __BSON__ or __JSON__.

    __JSON__ encoding is via the Mongo C driver utility function to convert
    __BSON__ to __JSON__.
