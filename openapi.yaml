  title: Version History REST API
  description: |
    REST API for common actions around document version history stored in
    __MongoDB__ via `mongo-service`.

    ### Formats
    Document payloads can be encoded as either __BSON__ or __JSON__.  This applies
    to both input document payloads (CRUD API), and for the the outputs for all
    API endpoints.

    __JSON__ encoding is via the Mongo C driver utility function to convert
    __BSON__ to __JSON__.

    ### Compression
    Compressed output is supported and encouraged.  Only `gzip` compression is
    supported by the service.  Output is compressed only if the output document
    size exceeds `128` bytes.

    ### Correlation Id
    Clients can specify a `correlationId` for each request
    if they wish to correlate log records that are generated across the system.
    This can be specified via a custom `x-spt-correlation-id` HTTP header.

      summary: Endpoint to retrieve documents with the specified combination.
      description: |
        Retrieve document(s) from the specified `database:collection`
        matching the specified combination of property name and value.

        Since the `value` is specified as a `path` parameter, this is intended
        for use for simple `string` values which do not have spaces or other
        special characters.  When specifying complex values, the request `path`
        must be properly *URL encoded*.

        The `property` **must** hold a `string` type value for this endpoint to
        work.  The only exception is the case for `_id`, in which case the
        `value` will be parsed as a **BSON Object Id**.  This also means that
        non object id `_id` values are not supported.

        The response will be the entire document(s) as stored in the specified
        database collection.

        If the `property` specified is the `_id` property the response will
        include only the `result` object.  For any other property (even if it
        is a *unique* property) the response will include the `results` array.
        The response will have only one or the other of `result` or `results`
        (mutually exclusive).

        Execute the specified query against the specified `database:collection`.

        If the `query` specified is the `_id` property the response will
        include only the `result` object.  For any other query the response will
        include the `results` array. The response will have only one or the
        other of `result` or `results` (mutually exclusive).

        __Note:__ If no `options` is specified a default `options` with a `limit`
        of `100` is applied.  This is to avoid running the instance out of memory
        unless the caller explicitly requests a larger result set.  When the caller
        explicitly specified `options`, the expectation is that the caller has
        also specified a *sane* `limit`.

            The query will be passed *as-is* to the `mongo-service`.  No properties
            are documented as there are no mandatory properties.  Consult the
            MongoDB documentation for valid query syntax.
          type: object
          example: {
            "group": "admin",
            "created": {"$gt": { "$date": "2020-08-18T12:30:00.000Z" } }
          }
        options:
          description: |
            Options to control output from the *query*.  Use to control result
            sorting, properties included in the returned documents etc.

            __Note:__ Callers are strongly adviced to *always* specify the
            `limit` option to restrict the maximum number of matching documents.
            Use standard *pagination* techniques (include a `$gt` clause when
            retrieving additional results) to ensure the query is optimal.
          type: object
          example: {
            "limit": 100,
            "sort": {"_id": -1},
            "projection": {"name": 1, "email": 1}
          }

    DeleteResponse:
      description: |
        Structure returned by the `delete` document endpoint. This is a
        simplified representation of the structure that is returned by the
        `mongo-service`.  In particular, the arrays returned by the service are
        transformed into singular objects since this endpoint only allows deleting
        a single document.
      type: object
      required:
        - _id
        - history
      properties:
        _id:
          type: string
          description: |
            BSON Object ID for the document that was deleted.  This is the same
            value that was specified in the path.

            __Note:__ When response data is in __JSON__ format, the `_id` is wrapped
            in an object (`"_id": { "$oid": "5f3bc9e29ba4f45f810edf22" }`) by
            the MongoDB C driver JSON converter.
          example: 5f3bc9e2502422053e08f9f1
        history:
          description: |
            Metadata about the version history document that was created as
            a result of deleting the specified document.  Clients may use this
            information to *revert* or *undo* the operation if so desired.
          type: object
          properties:
            _id:
              type: string
